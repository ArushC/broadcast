How to use these files:

1. Download and install the MCL library from https://github.com/herumi/mcl.
Instructions for how to build the library are at the bottom of the page.

2. Assuming the entire MCL library was installed in a folder called "mcl", place these folders in the following directory: /mcl/ffi/java

3. Compile and run. Programs can be run individually.

IMPORTANT: the most recent schemes and runtimes are in the folders "schemesRevised" and "runtimesRevised", respectively. The folders "schemes" and "runtimes" contain older versions of these files (which contain implementation errors).

SIDENOTE: The following research paper explains the runtimes and conducts a thorough data analysis: https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1525
