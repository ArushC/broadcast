How to use this file:

1. Download and install the MCL library from https://github.com/herumi/mcl
Instructions for how to build the library are at the bottom of the page.

2. Assuming the entire MCL library has been installed in a folder called "mcl",
place this file in the following directory: /mcl/ffi/java


3. Change the filepath on line #125 (on my computer, for some reason, the relative path does not work)
