How to use these files:

1. Download and install the MCL library from https://github.com/herumi/mcl
Instructions for how to build the library are at the bottom of the page.

2. Assuming the entire MCL library has been installed in a folder called "mcl", place these folders in the following directory: /mcl/ffi/java


3. Change the filepath when loading the library in the main() function for each program (on my computer, for some reason, the relative path does not work)

4. Compile and run. Programs can be run individually.
