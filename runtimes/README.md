The naming convention for all of the files/subdirectories can be explained as follows:

<u>Subdirectories:<u>

*logTimes -> testing runtimes with N = 10, N = 100, ..., N = 1 million, where N is the total number of users in the broadcast encryption system.
*linearTenThousandTimes -> testing runtimes with N = 1000, N = 2000, ..., N = 10000.
