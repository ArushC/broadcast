The naming convention for all of the files/subdirectories can be explained as follows:

**Subdirectories:**

* logTimes -> testing runtimes with N = 10, N = 100, ..., N = 1 million, where N is the total number of users in the broadcast encryption system.
* linearTenThousandTimes -> testing runtimes with N = 1000, N = 2000, ..., N = 10000.

**Filenames:**
* 1.txt -> testing runtimes where the subset size is 1% of the total number of users in the broadcast encryption system.
* 5.txt -> testing runtimes where the subset size is 5% of the total number of users in the broadcast encryption system.
...

The filename nonmenclature above also applies to 10.txt, 20.txt, and 50.txt.
